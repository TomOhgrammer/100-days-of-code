# 100 Days Of Code - Log
 
### Day 0: April 06, 2020
 
**Thoughts:** I want to start with this challenge I guess two month ago but my procrastination skills are much higher than the strength to break through it . But after two weeks of social distancing in my flat I am going to start with this challenge. 

At First I will build up my website again so I have a portfolio page. Therefore I decide to use not  just a static website but also donâ€™t want to setup one of the common CMs Systems like Joomla, Wordpress, drupal , etc. 

I read in the last weeks a view articles about head less CMS systems and that you can use them not just for one project but also for multiple website or app projects.

SO I decide to use the Headless CMS Cockpit, I just give it a try.

**Things done until now:** 
1.	Choosing a headless CMS [cockpit](https://getcockpit.com/)
2.	Installing XAMPP on my Windows machine
3.	Installing the CMS
4.  Creating new Repos for the Aktual Webpage and adjust the timer to end of April.
5.  Create a new Repo for the workin progress website
